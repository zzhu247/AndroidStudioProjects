Android App for SheHackers

Inspiration   

A fun way for youths ages 10 to 15 to start caring about their spending habits. Our team’s inspiration comes from the constant need to educate youths on finance and teaching them how to be more responsible with money. With the skills learned from this app, we believe we are preventing unnecessary spending among youths and promoting a wealthy future.


What it does

The app provides a space for users to create a personal wishlist for themselves where the items can easily arrange to help young teens identify where they really want spend their allowances. Users will also have access to a budgeting feature where they can see how much they have currently and how much they have spent. They also have the option to add monetary sources and indicate whether it’s an allowance, gift, or others. The app includes a unique feature to highlight the user’s top 3 spending categories and wishlists and an in-depth analysis, daily, weekly, and monthly. The app plans to be informational in the sense that it equips users with the knowledge of conscious spending 


How we built it

The main platforms used were Figma to prototype and Android Studio for the main code using Java language.


Challenges we ran into

We were all mostly new to creating mobile apps. The challenge for us was figuring out how to work with git and Android Studio 
Accomplishments that we are proud


We’re all proud of 

the skills we’ve acquired. Most of us have never used Android studio or create a mobile app before. Overcoming the hurdle of learning a new software and creating an awesome product was something we were all proud of! 


What we learned

We learned how to work together as a team virtually, and to divide up the tasks properly for a more efficient process. All of us learned how to use Android Studio!
